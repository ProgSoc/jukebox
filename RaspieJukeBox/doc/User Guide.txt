User Guide for RaspiJukebox

This guide is simply for the use and troubleshoot of the raspijukebox. If you want to modify the code this is probably not the guide you want.

Stuff Worth knowing:
No modification is needed to run it on something other than a raspberry pi, just turn the hardware off in the settings file.
To add or change the directory to search for tracks, simply change the settings.ini file.

How to get it up and running:
To get the jukebox up and running, simply run the startup (.sh or .bat) script in the bin folder. From there access it like a normal apache server.
WARNING!! Always Press play online before touching the hardware stuff on first startup.
Make sure that the settings file is properly configured.

Hardware Stuff:
PlayPause: Does what you'd expect. Never had an issue yet with it
Skip: Skips to the track. It's fairly tempermental and gets in way of file io from time to time which requires a reset
DeadMan: **Untested** at the time of writing this. Many logic errors. Like how it does not activate upon pressing play on the online modules wont activate the switch

TroubleShooting:
In almost all cases the issue has to do with the configuration of the settings file (especially if it has been recently changed). To get a wordier description of what is going on,
try running the jar file directly.

cd into webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib

to run use the command
sudo java -jar raspijukebox.jar true

The true command enables hardware interface.
That should show what the issue is. If that all works well then the issue will most likely be in the website portion.
